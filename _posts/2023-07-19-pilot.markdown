I have started my personal blog here in pursuit of keeping track of my workout habits.

### A little about myself
I purchased my first gravel bike- `Cannondale Topstone 2L` in Alkmaar, The Netherlands in August 2022.
It was a beautiful place to do cycling, only that it rains a little more often than I like in winter.
I frequented the sand dunes nearby Alkmaar in the beginning, including [Schoorlse duinen](https://www.staatsbosbeheer.nl/uit-in-de-natuur/locaties/schoorlse-duinen)
and [Geestmerambacht](https://www.geestmerambacht.nl/).

In Feburary 2023, I decided to return to Taiwan after being away for alsmot 9 years.
I started attending races and getting to know more about this country.

Photo below is my most recent race at Wuling, a 3275-meter high mountain peak in Nantou County.
